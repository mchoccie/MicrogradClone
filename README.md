# MicrogradClone
I tried implementing Micrograd following Andrej Karpathy's video. My primary goal was to gain a deep understanding of neural networks and delve into the intricacies of the backpropagation process. Although the project is still evolving, my focus is on adapting the API I created to effectively classify handwritten MNIST digits.

Having studied the contents of Andrej's video, I diligently replicated the provided code. This hands-on approach has proven invaluable in unraveling the inner workings of neural networks, allowing me to see beyond the surface-level concepts. While I acknowledge that the code may appear a bit untidy, it serves as a tangible representation of my ongoing learning journey, highlighting the iterative nature of my exploration.
