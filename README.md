# MicrogradClone
My attempt at implementing Micrograd from Andrej Kaparthy's video. The aim is to learn how neural networks operate and study the backpropagation process. The entire project is still a bit of a work in progress because I'm trying to apply the API created to classify handwritten MNIST digits. I watched the entire video and tried to replicate the code written by Andrej. It was a good way for me to understand what's going on "under the hood". The code here is a bit messy but it helps to showcase a little bit of my learning process.
